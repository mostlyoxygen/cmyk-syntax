# cmyk-syntax

A syntax theme using (something close to) three of the four printing colours
(k is covered by the background).

Because I find syntax highlighting more useful when reading code than writing
it this theme only highlights a few elements, such as class and function
definitions, return statements and comments.

The theme works for python, javascript and HTML. Mileage will vary in other
languages - if your favourite is missing raise an issue, or make the changes
and send me a pull request.
